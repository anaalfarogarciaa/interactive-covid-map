# interactive-covid-map
Background: 
This the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computing Inititive (CSSI). I collaborated with one team memerber: Ryan Gutierrez @ryan-Gzz

Tech/Functionality:
We used the p5 JavaScript library to build an interactive Coronavirus map. At the time when we participated in CSSI, Covid-19 was affecting our lives. As a result, we gathered the confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery numbers of a specific date to display the data on a map. The user can choose what data to view and on what type of map to view it. 

Setup intrsuctions:
If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
